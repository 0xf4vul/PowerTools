#Veil-PowerView

Veil-PowerView is a powershell tool to gain network situational awareness on 
Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-powershell replacements for various 
windows "net *" commands, which utilize powershell AD hooks and underlying 
Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality.

It also impements various useful metafunctions, including a port 
of [Rob Fuller's](https://twitter.com/mubix) [netview.exe](https://github.com/mubix/netview) tool,
and some custom-written 'UserHunter' functions which will identify where on the
network specific users are logged into. It can also check which machines
on the domain the current user has local administrator access on. See function
descriptions for appropriate usage and available options.


Veil-PowerView is a part of the [Veil-Framework](https://www.veil-framework.com/) 
and was developed by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).
